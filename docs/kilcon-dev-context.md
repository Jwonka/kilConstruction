# KilConstruction – Internal Development Context

This document is the single source of truth for how the kilConstruction system works.
Update it whenever we change architecture, security, or APIs.

## 1. High-level overview

**Goal:** Public marketing site + project gallery + client reviews for KIL Construction.

**Overall system stack**

- **Frontend:** Astro, static pages rendered on **Cloudflare Pages**.
- **Backend (system-wide):**
    - A **Cloudflare Worker** (`kilcon-gallery-worker`, defined and deployed directly in Cloudflare)  
      that handles `/api/gallery-api*` and `/api/reviews*` for gallery, reviews, and admin operations.
    - A **Cloudflare Worker** (`kilcon-contact`, also defined and deployed directly in Cloudflare)  
      that handles `POST /api/contact`, forwards form submissions to Resend, and always performs  
      Turnstile verification in production. This worker also does not live in this repository.

- **Storage:** Cloudflare **R2** for all photos and review JSON.
- **Spam protection:** Cloudflare **Turnstile** (contact + reviews).
- **Admin auth:** Cookie-based (`admin_auth`), backed by an `ADMIN_SECRET` in the external Worker
  and an Astro admin auth helper (`adminAuth.ts`) used by the admin frontend.

The public site is served from Cloudflare Pages at `https://kilcon.work`.

**This repository contains:**

- The **Astro frontend** deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

The gallery and review APIs used by the frontend:

- `kilcon.work/api/reviews*`
- `kilcon.work/api/gallery-api*`

> NOTE: The gallery and reviews endpoints described below are implemented in an
> external Cloudflare Worker, not in this repository. They are documented here
> so this repo’s frontend has a clear contract with the backend.

### 3. Admin credentials & session rotation

Admin authentication for the gallery/admin UI is backed by two key values in the runtime environment:

- `ADMIN_SECRET`
- `SESSION_VERSION`

#### ADMIN_SECRET

- Used as the HMAC key for signing `admin_auth` tokens.
- Never stored in this repository; configured only in Cloudflare.
- **Rotation policy:**
  - Rotate at least quarterly, and any time roles change or compromise is suspected.
  - When rotating `ADMIN_SECRET`, also bump `SESSION_VERSION` so all existing admin sessions are invalidated.

#### SESSION_VERSION

- Included as `ver` inside the token payload and enforced both:
  - In the Astro admin pages (login gate).
  - In the external gallery worker via `requireAdmin`.
- **Usage:**
  - Bump this value (e.g., `"1"` → `"2"`) whenever you want to force logout of all admin sessions without changing cookie names or other app logic.
  - Typical triggers: admin offboarding, major permission changes, or `ADMIN_SECRET` rotation.
